This parental leave goes on for up to 16 months in total, split between the parents. During this parental leave, the employer still:\n\n1. Recruits and hires substitutes,\n2. Pays employee tax,\n3. Pays the yearly vacation salary,\n4. Frequently (if mandated by e.g. a collective agreement struck between employer and union) pays an extra \"parental salary\" to complement what the state is handing out.\n\nIt's quite generous, and it probably goes without saying that it is also **illegal as fuck** for employers to cut pay or fire expecting mothers/parents for pregnancy reasons. Companies that try it anyway (citing BS reasons) risks getting dragged to court and sued for serious cash.\n\n>What does this have anything to do with feminism?\n\nThe definition of feminism, as found on Wikipedia:\n\n>Feminism is a range of social movements, political movements, and ideologies that aim to define and establish the political, **economic**, personal, and social equality of the sexes.\n\nWhat we're talking about here is *economic* equality between the sexes. Women should not risk workplace repercussions for getting pregnant while men go scot-free, especially since becoming a parent is 1) extremely common, 2) a huge deal in peoples' lives, and 3) actually desired by our society. :) Our species needs to procreate to continue its existence, so it makes zero sense to punish women for it.\n\nI'd like to think that the reason this works so well in my country, with employers and employees alike accepting this, is because the rules apply to everyone: companies can't get an edge by firing pregnant people when it suits them, so the playing field is level. Paying for employees on parental leave is just the cost of doing business here.\n\nUltimately, it is indeed an investment.

I really have to get this off my chest because I've seen this narrative too often. Just because he talked about equal rights and wrote some lyrics about it doesn't mean that he truly was a feminist. In fact, he was pretty much a hypocrite.\n\nHe assaulted his wife back in 1993 and was arrested for domestic violence. There's eyewitnesses saying how he used to throw Courtney's clothes off the window when they fought and they would often argue and have these huge blowups, all these while he nonchalantly told the media how great his family life was and how much he hated it when people pointed fingers at his perfectly fine marriage.\n\nHe tried to take advantage of a mentally impaired girl when he was in high school. People keep defending him to this day, saying that it's a made up story when Kurt himself admitted it to a journalist (there's literally proof of this because it's in an interview). He threatened to kill a journalist because she wanted to put out a book about Nirvana and expose him for who he was - again, with audio proof of him calling her sexist slurs and generally just awfully mysoginistic insults. There's even rumours that he had tried to rape a woman back in the late 80s. While unconfirmed, there's still lots of evidence that he was just plain creepy and disgusting. If you read his journals, he is literally obsessing over rape in a fetishism kind of way. He constantly mentions it, writes about it, makes up stories about rape and he just comes off as being infatuated or fascinated by it. Moreover than that, he objectifies women horribly and there's one journal entry where he literally admits that the only reason he supported the Riot Grrl movement is because he wanted to fuck one of its founding members.\n\nBack in 1994, just before a gig, Kurt found out that Courtney was cheating on him. His reaction? He changed the lyrics to one of the songs to \"my favourite dead whore\".\n\n \n\nI can't find a single sliver (whoops) of evidence that he was NOT a hypocritical asshole. Everyone just keeps defending him like he was some sort of saint. Cobain was no feminist and I hate it that there's like a fucking cult around protecting his image and people still reject his hypocrisy and find excuses for it to this day. I've done my extensive research on his life and personality and I've been reading stuff about him for years (up until a few months ago when I got bored and sick of the subject). If you actually read some books from other peoples' perspectives on him (people who have known him and worked with him) including friends or even staff, you'll quickly notice how a lot of people thought there was something wrong with him. And I've read a few enlightening books about him which were heavily criticized because diehard Nirvana fans just couldn't accept that their idol was an asshole.\n\nI said it and I'll always say it: Cobain's feminism was a hoax. It was an image he put up in the media so that everyone would like him. It was just a facade. 90% of the things he said in interviews were lies, therefore the constant contradictions he made. I won't get into too many details because there's A LOT to write but I believe that not only was he a hypocrite but he was also an abuser. He hated women.

I guess that women, as humans and social beings, cannot escape the burden of such roles nor completely avoid  incorporating those behaviours.

Her running gag is basically losing her clothes and running around mostly naked, some times she's fully naked and people just oogle her even though she's obviously flustered and uncomfortable. Then there are the Seven Deadly Sins, where the male lead gropes and talks about Elizabeth's boobs and hips for 'comedic effect'.\n\nLike bro, impressionable children are going to watch the show and think it's okay for them to touch girls' body parts without consent, since the male lead of that show never got told off or got in trouble.\n\n\\-\n\nThen there are the making female characters physically weak, or at least lesser to the male characters' strength. And that's like a whole other can of worms.\n\nI'd say Naruto is an amazing example of this, it's such a mainstream anime it's worrying about the effects it can have on people. \n\nIn Naruto, all the female character whole personality revolves around a guy, they have no character depth, no goals (apart from getting into their crushes pants) and not development. If you watch the Chunin Exam arc, there are no female finalists, all of them were knocked out with the most boring, shortest fights. There is only one female Hokage out of like 7, and she nearly got knocked out by the lackey of a sub villain. Not to mention all medic and support positions are filled by women, there are little to no male medics.

Is a woman unhappy? Give her something cute to wear. Or something sweet to eat. Women like cute things and sweets and all their problems can be solved with them. It's only natural for office workers of the female persuasion, \"office ladies\" as they're called, to be given the most tedious secretarial tasks, have them make tea for the men who have important meetings to attend, and pay them low salaries, because they'll get married and quit work anyway to become full-time homemakers while their husbands work until the last train home, living out their breadwinner lives in the office, bars (obligatory drinking with the higher-ups), and red-lights districts if they're sufficiently high on the company ladder (because it's such a good way to relax after successful business negotiations)...\n\nMany people I talked to firmly believed that Japan had achieved gender equality, which couldn't be further from the truth.

So it is more satisfying when he conquers them, makes them show \"feminine qualities\" (weakness and emotional instability), breaks their composure and of course exceeds them and saves them when they are inevitably put in a damsel-in-distress position. It is a mild version of an incredibly popular hentai genre where women in power are conquered, humiliated, raped and turned into sex slaves (and it is portrayed as if they give in to their desires and enjoy it and it is their female nature, for which they are of course also shamed).\n\nAnd then there is this obsession with gorgeous \"robot\" girls who are extremely naive and impressionable and don't know anything about the world, who have no shame and no boundaries, because they are that naive, and who are totally dependent on their \"average boy\" master. It's a \"born sexy yesterday\" trope where a man gets a slave who doesn't know any better, can't compare him to anyone and regards all his average actions and ideas as something extraordinary. Talk about gloryfying medicority.\n\nI agree that Naruto was a fucking *disaster*. In the last chapter of the manga the last time we see the lead female, who is supposedly an amazing medic with super strength, she is dusting shelves in an apron, taking care of a kid whose father has insulted and assaulted her multiple times, tried to murder her, and then abandoned her with a child. And it is portrayed as ultimate love. Omfg. I grew up with that manga. I followed that girl's story for years, rooting for her, hoping she would grow out of her toxic crush, hoping to see her lead and fight like she said she wanted, and after 10 years the last image of her I get is her dusting shelves for a guy who doesn't give a fuck. 99% of women who were warriors in that story ended up being housewives while men took all positions of power. \n\nFairy Tail is horrible too. So many people defend fanservice in Fairy Tail by saying that men there also have perfect bodies and are often shirtless, but it is such bullshit. Men are never stripped against their will, as they scream and beg \"don't do it\" or \"don't look\", they aren't groped, they aren't shamed for being shirtless, they rarely receive objectifying comments, while it happens to female characters all the time. Men are rarely drawn in their underwear or completely naked, and the camera is definitely never positioning to give us the best view of their crotch. And don't get me started on how often women's spaces are invaded by men who just barge in and make themselves comfortable while girls scream! It is ridiculous how often Lucy is portrayed shaking and crying, because she is stripped and groped by her best friend, the protagonist. And she never confronts him about it.\n\nIt is not just shounen animes. Most shoujo and josei mangas (girl mangas) I've read also glorify traditional female roles and portray jealousy and abuse from men as hot and desirable. Nothing makes a heroine more wet than a man imposing his dominance on her by pressing her to a wall or telling others that she is his property. And most shoujo heroines succeed in saving most vile and abusive men from themselves through patience and kindness and empathy, which is a horrible message to feed to young girls. The very fact that 80% - 90% of \"girl mangas\" are focused primarily on love and finding a husband while \"boy mangas explore themes of competition, leadership, professional development, athletisim, stoicism - is very problematic.

Sora is coded as the \"acceptable girl or way to woman\" while Mimi is coded as whiny or high maintenance for voicing her wants or needs in ways that the boys don't (i.e. Tai's brief time back home has him enjoying the AC where something like that would have Mimi ridiculed).\n* Somehow they are often (mostly Sora) always put in charge of the smaller kids while the boys get to explore or fight.\n* Sora gets domesticated which, if her choice, cool but it does bleed into a 1950s stereotype where the Tomboy is always made feminine. \n* Also the fans disliking Mimi for her brattiness, or rather that she is outspoken about her wants and needs in a way most girls are discouraged and she is A PRETEEN.\n* Kari and Sora are shown as Cool Girl and Sweet Angel in contrast to Mimi's all too human and relatable girliness. \n* Somehow the episodes after Kari came had the girls talking less to one another\n* It's all about the guys\n\n**Feminist:**\n\n* This scene is worthy of a sign at the Women's March. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DMDbgghpMM&t=2s&ab\\_channel=ThatCrazyGuy2731\n* Mimi is someone who is girly but also a frickin' badass and honest as hell. Underrated as hell.\n* All the girls, different seasons, are shown to be friendly and supportive of one another. No one stages a catfight against another girl on their side.\n* Mimi doesn't try to girlify Sora and Sora doesn't try to de-girly Mimi.\n* The Digimon forms represent different nuances of the characters: cute, big and badass, badass and conventionally feminine, etc. \n* Sora and Mimi play off one another and complement one another.\n\nIt's too bad we don't have more scenes of the girls.

Then I compare that to the United Christ Church I went to after college, where there was this incredible woman pastor with a doctorate in theology, LGBTQ+ folks were openly embraced (like, seriously, there were rainbow flags on every wall), when they spoke about God, they used all different gendered pronouns and called God the Holy Parent instead of the Father, and where they never read a single passage from the old testament. Yes they are both Christians, but I couldn't imagine anyone describing the UCC as misogynistic. I don't go to that church anymore either, I'm more nontheist/agnostic these days. My parents aren't Catholic anymore either, they go to a Lutheran church now. Which isn't nearly as liberal as the UCC, but the pastor's son there gave a speech at service during pride month about how we as Christians need to do a better job about including our LGBTQ+ siblings. And I feel like it's a largely positive community. I think for people whose faith is deeply precious to them, and part of their cultural identity, it's insulting to them to be told that their identity is problematic.

He posted this letter some months back to the PCVAI (people conceived via artificial insemination) yahoo group, which can be found here. The first article is from The Medical World, and the second article is an excerpt from a paper that Bill wrote for a class in Reproductive Issues in the Philosophy Department at the University of Utah. I am posting these two articles here, with Bill\u2019s permission.\n\nI thought it was important to post this letter in its entirety.\n\n>The Medical World, April 1909 pp. 163-164: Letter to the Editor  \n>  \n>Artificial Impregnation  \n>  \n>Editor Medical World:  \n>  \n>It has been twenty-five years since Professor Pancoast performed the first artificial impregnation of a woman, in the Sansom Street hospital of Jefferson Medical College, in Philadelphia. At that time the procedure was so novel, so peculiar in its human ethics, that the six young men of the senior class who witnest \\[witnessed?\\] the operation were pledged to absolute secrecy. The circumstances of the case were about as follows:  \n>  \n>A wealthy merchant of Philadelphia consulted Professor Pancoast to learn why his home was childless. The man was forty-one years of age, of sound body as far as he knew, had a good family history, and had never suffered from any serious illness in his life, barring a slight attack of gonorrhea in his youth, while sowing the proverbial \u201cwild oats.\u201d  \n>  \n>His wife was ten years his junior, a perfect picture of health, and a product one of the old Quaker families of wealth and distinction in Quakerville.  \n>  \n>An appointment was made with the both for an examination at the Sansom Street hospital, and a section of the senior class, of which I was one, was called upon to assist the Professor. The supposition on the part of the Professor was that the woman was unable to conceive because of some impediment which possibly might be removed. Therefore, she was examined first. The examination was very complete, almost as perfect as an army examination, but not the slightest abnormal condition was discovered. As a matter of possible public interest, I will say that during this examination was discovered for the first time, as far as I know, the suction function of the uterus, which takes place during orgasm.  \n>  \n>The man was then examined; and while no physical defect was discoverable, the spermatic fluid was shown by the microscopic examination to be absolutely void of spermatozoons. This, of course, cleared up the situation at once, and the man was informed that the fault was his, and probably due to results of the gonorrhea in his youth. Professor Pancoast at that time considered the trouble as easily remedied, and began a course of treatment which he thought proper.  \n>  \n>But after two months\u2019 careful attention, the man showed no change whatever, and the Professor then concluded that the primary seminal ducts were occluded by the former inflammation extending upward from the urethra. A joking remark by one the class, \u201cthe only solution of this problem is to call in the hired man,\u201d was the probable incentive to the plan of action which followed. The woman was chloroformed, and with a hard rubber syringe some fresh semen from the best-looking member of the class was deposited in the uterus, and the cervix slightly plugged with gauze. Neither the man nor the woman knew the nature of what had been done at the time, but subsequently the Professor repented of his action, and explained the whole matter to the husband. Strange as it may seem, the man was delighted with the idea, and conspired with the Professor in keeping from the lady the actual way by which her impregnation was brought about. In due course of time the lady gave birth to a son, and he had characteristics features, not of the senior student, but of the willing but impossible father.  \n>  \n>That boy is now a business man of the city of New York, and I have shaken his hands with him within the past year.  \n>  \n>Since then there has been formed an association for the purpose of producing artificial impregnation of women who may for any reason give a written consent to such a proceeding. From a nature point of view the idea of artificial impregnation offers valuable advantages. The mating of human beings must, from the nature of things, be a matter of sentiment alone. Persons of the worst possible promise of good and healthy offspring are being lawfully united in marriage everyday. Marriage is a proposition which is not submitted to good judgment or even common sense, as a rule. No Burbank methods are possible, even tho they be ideal. Artificial impregnation by carefully selected seed, alone will solve the problem. It may at first shock the delicate sensibilities of the sentimental who consider that the source of the seed indicates the true father, but when the scientific fact becomes known that the origin of the spermatozoa which generates the ovum is of no more importance that the personality of the finger which pulls the trigger of a gun, then objections will lose their forcefulness, and artificial impregnation become recognized as a race-uplifting procedure.  \n>  \n>It is gradually becoming well established that the mother is the complete builder of the child. It is her blood that gives it material for its body, and her nerve energy which is divided to supply its vital force. It is her mental ideals which go to influence, to some extent at least, the features, the tendencies, and the mental caliber of the child. \u201cMany a man rocks another man\u2019s child and thinks he is rocking his own,\u201d for it looks like him. And often two children by the same parents have feature entirely dissimilar. It is the predominating mental ideals prevailing with the mother that shapes the destiny of the child. The man who thrusts his nose into a beautiful blossom to surfeit his sense of smell on the sweet perfume is merely breathing the lustful odor from the sexual organ of the plant; and if his nose displaces some of the pollen, he may be the father of the next flower. If a honey bee does the work, it might be called the father.  \n>  \n>A scientific study of sex selection, without regard to marriage conditions, might result in giving some men children of wonderful endowments, in place of half-witted, evil-inclined, disease-disposed offspring which they are ashamed to call their own. The mechanical method of impregnation, whether it be the orthodox way, or the aseptic surgeon\u2019s skillful fingers, counts but little, except sentiment, and sentiment is fast becoming a servant instead of a master in the affairs of the human race. Few are the children that are brought intentionally into this world. As a rule they are but the incidental result of a journey in search of selfish pleasure. They are seldom sought, and often unwelcome when they pout in their first appearance. The subsequent mother\u2019s love is largely a matter of growth, for affection is but an attribute of selfishness.  \n>  \n>The man who may think this idea shocking probably has millions of gonococci swarming in his seminal ducts, and probably his wife has had a laparotomy which nearly cost her life itself, as a result of his infecting her with the crop reaped from his last planting of \u201cwild oats.\u201d One man in every five in New York City was found to be free from the contamination of venereal disease to an extant that rendered him safe \\[\"unsafe?\"\\] around the house in which a woman lived.  \n>  \n>Go ask the blind children whose eyes were saturated with the gonorrheal pus as they struggled thru the birth canal to merge into this world of darkness to endure a Living Death; ask them what is the not shocking thing in this whole world. Ask Helen Keller what is the most shocking thing in this sin-soaked ball of selfish pursuits. They will tell you it is the idea that man, wonderful man, is infecting 80 percent of all womankind with the satanic germs collected by him as his youthful steps wandered in the \u201cbad lands.\u201d A.

From the start, at least as far as we can tell from the first purported use of donor insemination in 1884 by Dr. William Pancoast (The Medical World, April 1909 pp. 163-164: Letter to the Editor), it appears that one of his unknown medical students, jokingly called the \u201cHired Hand,\u201d was used in order to deceive the wife about the process and to encourage her to believe that her husband was the father. There was no informed consent and the husband was told only after the wife became pregnant. Professor Pancoast then set up an \u201cassociation for the purpose of producing artificial impregnation of women who may for any reason give a written consent to such a proceeding.\u201d \\[ibid. Medical World\\]. It is implied that the business of donor insemination then began and followed informed consent but nothing is said about anonymity. The inference from this article is that the \u201cimpregnator\u201d is not significant since the mother is the \u201cis the complete builder of the child.\u201d The writer then goes on to add that \u201cthe origin of the spermatozoa,,, is of no more importance that the personality of the finger which pulls the trigger of a gun\u2026 (and therefore)\u2026 artificial impregnation \\[should\\] become recognized as a race-uplifting procedure.\u201d \\[Cite Medical World\\]. From the attitude of the letter writer it seems clear that he advocates the use of artificial insemination using \u201ccarefully selected seed.\u201d In other words, this first use of DI is touted as a way for society to become the \u201cmaster in the affairs of the human race.\u201d As reported in an article called \u201cThe Impregnators\u201d in \u201cFertility and Sterility\u201d (A. T. Gregoire, PhD and Robert C. Mayer, MD; F&S vol.16, no. 6, 1965, p. 130 \u2013 134) the 1909 letter caused a debate between those who felt DI violated the laws of God, \u201cridiculously criminal,\u201d \u201cneither honest nor moral,\u201d to those who support the eugenic idea that artificial impregnation \u201ccould improve the genetic stock of America.\u201d The moral criticisms of the act were dismissed \u201csince the question of morals belonged in the theological journal, not a scientific publication.\u201d \u201cDoctors have enough of the laws of God when they are young\u2026\u201d and \u201cwithout disrespect to Nature and Nature\u2019s God, they (doctors) modify creation and improve it with intelligence.\u201d After this brief uproar the practice went underground so that we know very little about the early years of donor insemination. Discussion of artificial reproduction appeared in various journals and lectures as early as 1910 (Hermann Muller) and even in literature such as Buck Mulligan\u2019s proposal for a \u201cfertilising farm to be named Omphalos with an obelisk\u201d erected (phallic pun intended by Joyce) in the \u201cOxen of the Sun\u201d episode of Ulysses (1922; 14: lines 651 to 737) as well as in Huxley\u2019s Brave New World (1932). Actual mention of DI as a current practice is rarely mentioned, although we can\u2019t assume that it didn\u2019t continue. If it was practiced, then it survived under a cloak of secrecy reinforced with instructions to recipients to refrain from telling their children.  \n>  \n>Excerpts from various early guides for fertility often stress that the identity of the donors must obviously remain anonymous. For example, W. J. Finegold wrote (Artificial Insemination; Springfield Illinois, Charles C. Thomas; 1964) that \u201cthe donors should be veiled in absolute obscurity.\u201d M. Glezerman (\u2018Two hundred and seventy cases of artificial donor insemination,\u2019 Fertility and Sterility 1981:35:180-7) wrote \u201cthe donor semen should be regarded as \u2018material from an anonymous testis\u2019\u201d and that the genetic father is actually a \u201cnon-person.\u201d Although 1982 marked the first break from anonymous donors through The Sperm Bank of California, a nonprofit feminist clinic, Sherman Silber (How To Get Pregnant; Little, Brown and Company; 2005, p. 415) wrote that \u201cthe majority of physicians still oppose identity release donors, with the (Unsubstantiated) claim that the vast majority of couples prefer anonymous sperm.\u201d", "replies": []}, {"dict Id": 26, "Comment Id": "h89kz72", "Parent Id": "h87bo57", "content": "An interesting (read: stupid) tidbit of information is that the word \u2018hysterical\u2019 comes from the Greek word \u2018hystera\u2019, meaning \u2018uterus\u2019 (another example of this root is in the word \u2018hysterectomy\u2019).

As soon as I read the article heading I knew it had to be written by a man.

And even encouraged readers to initiate these exchanges with people who are at work.  Though there were claims that these exchanges were all positive for both parties, in no case were the people who were approached at random interviewed for their actual thoughts on the matter.\n\nAt best, this article seems like it should have been titled \"Extroverted people enjoy their interactions with random strangers\" but for anyone who is already struggling with random strangers approaching them in threatening ways, it just seems like it's grossly reckless in normalizing adjacent behavior and encourages an entitlement to the time, attention, and space of others.

It suggests that if only women can break through internal \"taboos\", we will have sexual freedom.
