Even with that being said, the difference in premiums are not huge. \n\n\\- Your second point doesn\u2019t make much sense to me. Five, single ounce coins take up just as much space as a 5oz bar. 20oz in a tube is a lot of value and just as easy, if not easier to store than two 10oz bars.\n\n\\- Your third point also makes no sense.

Go to coin shops & pawn shops to look at gold coins or items. Look at the variations in color between types of coins, especially Krugarrands. If possible, hold some coins. Get a jewelers loop*** to look closely at the coins or jewelry. Look for color variations in the different items and carat weights. Hold some coins. Ask questions about how different shops evaluate the gold items, especially coins. Don't buy anything for at least a couple of months, just look around while you save up to invest. Get familiar with holding various gold products in various weights. I was always surprised in the differences between how gold coins and silver coins feel in the hand, the weight differences compared to diameter of of the coins or items. In other words, give yourself all the time you need to become familiar with how gold feels and looks in different in different caret weights. Read, watch various videos and most important, learn tactile / hands on info about gold products, takes some of the intimidation out of the process.  \n\n***a good loop to buy for general use for coins is a 10x loop because it's much easier to see things on coin surfaces, learn to use, rather than a high powered loop used for gemstones. I carry a 10x loop as well as a 20x loop with me. It's much easier to get used to using a loop with a 10x loop, get comfortable with the viewing and testing equipment. Get yourself a gold test kit and just test things, get comfortable with using the test acids and familiar with what you're seeing for results. Hint: use a \"white test stone\" instead of the more common black test stones and you'll be able to notice and learn about the test procedures which will make you a more knowledgeable buyer and therefore, more confident in your decision about what to buy. \n\n Give yourself the time and mental space to learn about gold products and items before you commit your cash to a purchase. Once you get relaxed talking & interacting with pawn & coin shop personnel, then you can START to hone in on the type of products you want. For example, Krugerrand have a distinctive color and weight for a one oz coin, differs from a Gold Eagle which is different from a Chinese Panda.

But gold bullion, which includes gold bars, are from 99.5% to 99.9999% fine. Meaning that at the high end there is only .5% of the bullion that isn\u2019t gold, and at the low end only .0001% that isn\u2019t gold. There are some countries, the US included, that sells 21k bullion, but it isn\u2019t typical world wide. But, if you buy 21k bullion that is issued by your country, you will get full price when you sell. So in the US, if you buy American Gold Eagles, you will get the full price back when selling even though it\u2019s only 21k. But if you bought a Great Britain gold Sovereign, which is also 21k, you will probably get 98% of spot when selling to a gold shop in the US. \n\nIs gold naturally 24k? Rarely. Natural gold is usually around 21k and it is refined to get out other metals to make it more pure. Jewelry is usually where the 9k, 10k, 14k, 18k, 22k, and 24k comes into play. Corporate jewelry stores, such as Zales, sells 10k gold typically. They pitch it by saying, \u201cthe other metals that are mixed with the gold make it more durable.\u201d That is true in some cases, such as the jewelry being less prone to scratches, but it isn\u2019t true in terms of the brittleness or longevity of the jewelry. The higher the karat jewelry, the less brittle it is. But also the more scratches it will get. \n\nGold jewelry comes in what is called an \u201calloy\u201d and 24k means that the metal is 24/24 percent gold. 10k means that the gold is 10/24 percent gold, or around 42%. What the other 58% of the alloy is in 10k gold really comes down to who is selling it. Some jewelers will mix it with copper, silver, etc. \n\nPersonally? I believe that most corporate jewelers mix their gold so they can sell it as gold (meaning it will be expensive) while being able to produce more jewelry since they aren\u2019t using up as much gold. I have 3 23-24k chains and they aren\u2019t \u201cweak\u201d like a lot of people say.

We're here to help. Most gold isn't 24k right out of the ground. Some is but typically 20-24k all the 10k,14k,18k gold you see in jewlery usually starts out  from a 24k bar,coin, round etc .and then has other metals melted in with it to get the desired karat before the product is made. Once they get the alloy they want then they start production. \n\n\nYou most certainly CAN buy specific karat gold from certain supply shops usually in wire form or sheet form but those places are typically fairly high premium. You are much better off buying a finished product. There are of course custom jewelers who will make exactly what you are looking for in whatever karat you want but expect to pay 30-100% premium on the weight for highly custom products. \n\n\nAlso avoid the \"we buy gold\" shops or pawn shops to sell unwanted gold. You will be lucky to get anywhere near melt value 80% melt would be good. If you really don't want to sell on r/pmsforsale (which will absolutely get you the best price for your unwanted metals) \n\nTake it to a reputable coin/bullion shop. Typically those guys will way outpace the pawn shops and \"we buy gold\" guys. 95-100% melt value is fairly typical and even over spot sometimes for the right piece in the right shop. \n\n\nAs for the refining of gold.

If a precious metal is something you want, buy it (within means of course). I take solace in buying gold or silver because I want it, and have come to enjoy the collecting aspect.

Personally, I don\u2019t think we will see that number again without something major happening in the world.

I\u2019d say that\u2019s a pretty good deal these days.\n\nThe same scenario could play out with gold. You could make a chain and the value of the gold drop $600 an ounce over the course of 5 years. After 5 years, you get in a bind and need to sell it at a loss. You still got value (and drip \ud83d\ude02) out of those 5 years. The difference between that scenario and the poker scenario is that after the 5 years, you still have a tangible asset with gold, and if you don\u2019t get in a bind, you can wait out the pendulum swings and find a better time to sell.\n\nNot trying to push you one way or the other, I just want to provide you with a different perspective.

I do take issue, however, with this:\n\n> since 1960 and you will notice that 1971 was the pivotal moment\n\nI agree, it got us away from pegging our dollar to gold. That's a good thing. The gold standard has no place in today's modern society where economies aren't local or even regional, but global. According to virtually every single economist, the gold standard was the reason the great depression lasted *a decade*. It lasted as long as it did because the gold standard prevented the Federal Reserve from expanding the money supply to stimulate the economy, fund insolvent banks and fund government deficits. It literally tied the hands of our government.\n\nA return to the gold standard today would completely obliterate our economy and cripple our country in a way that's never happened before. Sure, the dollar would rise significantly in value (compared to other currencies) but that's not a good thing. It means trade with other countries would completely cease as it would be too expensive to do business with us. \n\nYou think inflation is bad? There's something worse, much worse that can happen (and would happen) if we switched back over: deflationary spiral. These are *much* more worse for an economy than inflation as they are harder to stop. If you want to see the effects of a *tiny* deflationary spiral just look at Japan from 1990-2000. Practically zero economic growth due to very mild deflation.\n\nIs our current system perfect? Of course not. It has flaws, *many* flaws in fact. But it's still tens if not hundreds of times better than the gold freaking standard. Having a fiat currency allows us to be more nimble which is essential for competition in a global economy.

I would check your sources.\n\nStarting with Hoover they country went hard into deficits trying to stimulate the economy funding projects like the Hoover dam.  Then FDR (who initially criticized Hoover for his spending spree) went, what the thought, was all in and spent even more.\n\nAfter becoming active in WW2, the US government ran such high deficits and racked up so much debt that as a proportion of GDP wasn\u2019t exceeded until the Pandemic.\n\nWhile it wasn\u2019t Bretton Woods, it was a gold standard.  There is no objective evidence the ability to run high deficits was constrained to the point of being unable to respond to crisis.  It was a question of political will, not a limitation of the monetary system.  Nor did it create an inescapable trap.\n\nIt\u2019s just history.\n\nThere are a lot of pros and cons to any monetary system comparison.  But that one doesn\u2019t stand up to even a casual glance through a history book, and is obliterated on close examination.\n\nNot sure how that re-writing of history gained traction.  Even at an extreme existential crisis, like the US Civil War it can temporarily abandon (it was a dual metallic system at the time iirc) and jumped back in once the crisis was resolved.
