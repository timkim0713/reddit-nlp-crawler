This parental leave goes on for up to 16 months in total, split between the parents. During this parental leave, the employer still:\n\n1. Recruits and hires substitutes,\n2. Pays employee tax,\n3. Pays the yearly vacation salary,\n4. Frequently (if mandated by e.g. a collective agreement struck between employer and union) pays an extra \"parental salary\" to complement what the state is handing out.\n\nIt's quite generous, and it probably goes without saying that it is also **illegal as fuck** for employers to cut pay or fire expecting mothers/parents for pregnancy reasons. Companies that try it anyway (citing BS reasons) risks getting dragged to court and sued for serious cash.\n\n>What does this have anything to do with feminism?\n\nThe definition of feminism, as found on Wikipedia:\n\n>Feminism is a range of social movements, political movements, and ideologies that aim to define and establish the political, **economic**, personal, and social equality of the sexes.\n\nWhat we're talking about here is *economic* equality between the sexes. Women should not risk workplace repercussions for getting pregnant while men go scot-free, especially since becoming a parent is 1) extremely common, 2) a huge deal in peoples' lives, and 3) actually desired by our society. :) Our species needs to procreate to continue its existence, so it makes zero sense to punish women for it.\n\nI'd like to think that the reason this works so well in my country, with employers and employees alike accepting this, is because the rules apply to everyone: companies can't get an edge by firing pregnant people when it suits them, so the playing field is level. Paying for employees on parental leave is just the cost of doing business here.\n\nUltimately, it is indeed an investment.

Personally, I'd argue that in terms of foreign policy, the two US parties are not too different. The US(or any of its allies) were never in Afghanistan to secure women's rights even if that was a by product of their activities. Frankly, the US failed most of its actual strategic goals in being in Afghanistan and had no real support to stay( across the political spectrum the American people's appetite for intervention in the Muslim majority world seems to be far less than the post-9/11 high). I would say that the pulling out of American forces is to expected regardless of who was in charge.
