The iCC/IOC can just award the Windies a different numbers of places depending on whether they want an 8, 12, 16, 24 etc team competition. I'm sure they'll just use England's results for a Team GB, and Ireland (which in Cricket represent both NI and ROI) to just be the Republic. \n\n\n> I think the only countries/boards that would give a shit about Olympic cricket would be South Asia, who between them won a total of seven medals in Tokyo (actually all seven were Indian). That's a solid day in the pool for Australia, or a good session at the velodrome for the UK.\n\nThat's still the IOC guaranteeing 2B engaged fans in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan (And Bhutan, Nepal even without their teams likely to qualify for anything less than a 16 team tournament). Outside of South Asia, South Africa would be great medal chances as well and only won a single gold at the last olympics. \n\nAustralia still really get behind their team sports at the games and there is a lot of focus on non-swimming medals explicitly because the Swimming medals are expected. Not to mention that Cricket is the de-facto national sport here.\n\n\nThere are plenty of issues with Cricket going to the olympics, but I think most can be overcome.

The body of the fallen was placed upon a funeral pyre, offerings or sacrifices are made, and the pyre burnes. In the funeral games was an opportunity for Greek men to compete and show their Arete, or excellence, in a given skill. Events like; Chariot races, boxing, wrestling, running, sword fighting, shotputting, archery, and javelin throwing. The winners of the contests could hope to be awarded the glorious olive wreath crown; or other precious objects like tripods or horses. In fact these funerary competitive games are seen as the ancient roots of the Olympic games. Although it was Hercules who created the first Olympic games to honor his father, Zeus.\r  \n\r  \nLet\u2019s take a look at Atalanta\u2019s wrestling partner; Peleus, who plays an important role in Greek myth. As one of the heroes of the Argonautica, he later becomes a king of Phthia (in Thessaly) and is most famous for his marriage to the sea nymph Thetis. Zeus learned the prophecy that through his coupling with Thetis, her offspring would overthrow the Olympians, so he gave Thetis to a mortal; King Peleus. Chiron the centaur gave King Peleus the tip that he should ambush and hold tight to Thetis, as she transformed between forms. After succeeding to capture her, she agrees to marry, and the gods attend the wedding ceremony. This is the banquet where Eris, goddess of discord, sneaks in the golden apple inscribed with \u201cfor the farest,\u201d setting off an argument between Athena, Hera, and Aphrodite. When Paris, prince of troy is Aphrodite promising Helen to Paris, setting off the Trojan war.\r  \n\r  \nThanks for looking and reading!

Eric regularly made the lengthy, dangerous journey between Siaochang and Tientsin in bitter cold temperatures in the late 1930s to get medical supplies, food, and 60 tons of anthracite to help the displaced, destitute, and battered villagers of Siaochang. The journey took days to weeks sometimes due to the routes he had to take to avoid Japanese checkpoints during the war. He had guns pointed at him by bandits and Japanese soldiers, was robbed multiple times, was often detained or shot at, yet he fearlessly continued helping the downtrodden Chinese villagers. \n\nWhen Eric was made a prisoner of war and sent to the Japanese internment camp in Weihsien, he became \u201cUncle Eric\u201d to hundreds of children who were separated from their parents. He was separated from his wife and children, too, and he took it upon himself to be a surrogate father to these kids and teenagers. He taught them mathematics and chemistry and even wrote a chemistry textbook from memory in the prison camp since the kids had no science learning materials. He transformed an internment camp into a place of hope for these kids \u2014 playing basketball, hockey and baseball with them (using makeshift hockey sticks)\u2026creating a game night where the kids play him in chess and do square dancing \u2026 organizing running events with the youth \u2026 Bible studies for those who were interested \u2026 always making himself available as a listening ear or to talk about anything the youth wanted\u2026 \n\nHe would wake up early every morning for 1-2 hours of quiet time with God, and then quietly volunteer to do all the grimy work that others didn\u2019t want to do to make things easier on the adults, such as leading roll call, cleaning the overflowing and filthy latrines, pumping well water, fixing anything that was broken, sweeping the floors, killing rats, etc.  Those in the camp who were selfish barely even noticed. \n\nEric had hoped to re-unite with his wife and children in Toronto and serve the indigenous / First Nation population over there, but sadly never got the chance. \n\nEric Liddell epitomizes what it means to be a true Christian.

While 7s does have annual competitions, they don't compete with the Olympics in the same way as rugby/football world cups do.\n- 7s already has an established format for hosting a tournament in a weekend at a single venue (going all the way back to Melrose Sevens). This is critical as it helps fit into an already tightly packed Olympics schedule and minimises the venues required vs a full 15s tournaments.\n- 7s entourages are much, much smaller than 15s. This means less demand on the Olympic Village, transport etc. This also makes it more affordable for smaller countries to send teams (see how some countries struggle to afford to send a team to RWC).\n- The Olympics require sports to be equal now. 7s is easier to support on the Women's side than 15s. Look at how most six nations teams have recently given professional contracts to women.\n- 7s is more competitive for smaller countries, increasing their chance of a medal (e.g. Fiji). This is an important Olympics consideration.\n- 7s players tend to have 7s contracts. Fewer issues with players having to be released by clubs or interfering with test match windows.\n\n\nFrom a rugby POV\n- 7s is seen as a way to promote the game to people who would otherwise not watch 15s. See also RugbyX.\n- For Team GB at least, a joint 7s team is less controversial than joint 15s or highest ranked nation. Also avoids conflict with the B&I Lions and opening that can of worms.\n- World Rugby doesn't want to be excluded from the Olympics anymore. They want the same exposure other sports get. 7s is the best way to ensure they can be part of the Olympics.\n- 7s is a more accessible game. The rules are simpler (insofar as most of the complex situations we see in the 15s game never actually arise due to fewer players, more space and basic set pieces) and you don't need so many players. This means kids watching are more likely to be inspired to start around anything vaguely egg shaped.\n- It gives smaller countries a higher profile in World Rugby.", "replies": [20]}, {"dict Id": 2, "Comment Id": "ifkt31f", "Parent Id": "vvn3su", "content": "Rugby Union is an incredibly physically taxing game to play, in the Rugby world cup you have an almost week long wait in between matches, which wouldn't work in the Olympics.", "replies": []}, {"dict Id": 3, "Comment Id": "ifkupir", "Parent Id": "vvn3su", "content": "Because the Olympics only last two weeks.
