An exchange for someone's image to promote your product is not like investing in securities, startups, or properties. Its not subject to the same taxation laws or accounting rules. Nike doesn't expect to use anyone's image in 15-30 years years.

This parental leave goes on for up to 16 months in total, split between the parents. During this parental leave, the employer still:</span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">1. Recruits and hires substitutes,</span><span class="s2">\n</span><span class="s1">2. Pays employee tax,</span><span class="s2">\n</span><span class="s1">3.

Women should not risk workplace repercussions for getting pregnant while men go scot-free, especially since becoming a parent is 1) extremely common, 2) a huge deal in peoples' lives, and 3) actually desired by our society. :) Our species needs to procreate to continue its existence, so it makes zero sense to punish women for it.</span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">I'd like to think that the reason this works so well in my country, with employers and employees alike accepting this, is because the rules apply to everyone: companies can't get an edge by firing pregnant people when it suits them, so the playing field is level. Paying for employees on parental leave is just the cost of doing business here.</span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">Ultimately, it is indeed an investment.

While we were out, my friend was scrolling through Tinder looking for a girl to hook up with. She was showing us some of the girls on there to get our opinions which was going pretty well until my boyfriend made a comment that a girl on there was pretty but you could tell she was bigger. The comment didn't really phase me, because I just saw it as a preference just like not being attracted to blondes for example. You mainly judge people on Tinder based on looks, and if you are hooking up with someone there should be physical attraction. My friend stated that she didn't care if a girl was bigger, and I thought that was the end of it since everyone had shared their opinion on the matter. Later on in the night I was talking to my friend and she said that my boyfriend was being sexist because of the comment he made. I didn't really see it that way, but I don't want anyone to be uncomfortable. Is there something I am not seeing?&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;comments&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s0">[{</span><span class="s1">&quot;dict Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s3">0</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;Comment Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;h8kesuf&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;Parent Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;p2cns7&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;content&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;</span><span class="s2">\n</span><span class="s1">I guess patriarchy works in strange ways and somebody could argue that specific norms like being thin/blonde/redhead and whatnot, are imposed socially to discriminate between women and put values on women with said characteristics, to cultivate a more hostile environment between women. </span><span class="s2">\n</span><span class="s1">I think many people have a blurred view on what is sexist.

I really have to get this off my chest because I've seen this narrative too often. Just because he talked about equal rights and wrote some lyrics about it doesn't mean that he truly was a feminist. In fact, he was pretty much a hypocrite.</span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">He assaulted his wife back in 1993 and was arrested for domestic violence. There's eyewitnesses saying how he used to throw Courtney's clothes off the window when they fought and they would often argue and have these huge blowups, all these while he nonchalantly told the media how great his family life was and how much he hated it when people pointed fingers at his perfectly fine marriage.</span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">He tried to take advantage of a mentally impaired girl when he was in high school. People keep defending him to this day, saying that it's a made up story when Kurt himself admitted it to a journalist (there's literally proof of this because it's in an interview). He threatened to kill a journalist because she wanted to put out a book about Nirvana and expose him for who he was - again, with audio proof of him calling her sexist slurs and generally just awfully mysoginistic insults. There's even rumours that he had tried to rape a woman back in the late 80s. While unconfirmed, there's still lots of evidence that he was just plain creepy and disgusting. If you read his journals, he is literally obsessing over rape in a fetishism kind of way. He constantly mentions it, writes about it, makes up stories about rape and he just comes off as being infatuated or fascinated by it. Moreover than that, he objectifies women horribly and there's one journal entry where he literally admits that the only reason he supported the Riot Grrl movement is because he wanted to fuck one of its founding members.</span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">Back in 1994, just before a gig, Kurt found out that Courtney was cheating on him. His reaction? He changed the lyrics to one of the songs to </span><span class="s2">\&quot;</span><span class="s1">my favourite dead whore</span><span class="s2">\&quot;</span><span class="s1">.</span><span class="s2">\n\n \n\n</span><span class="s1">I can't find a single sliver (whoops) of evidence that he was NOT a hypocritical asshole. Everyone just keeps defending him like he was some sort of saint. Cobain was no feminist and I hate it that there's like a fucking cult around protecting his image and people still reject his hypocrisy and find excuses for it to this day. I've done my extensive research on his life and personality and I've been reading stuff about him for years (up until a few months ago when I got bored and sick of the subject). If you actually read some books from other peoples' perspectives on him (people who have known him and worked with him) including friends or even staff, you'll quickly notice how a lot of people thought there was something wrong with him. And I've read a few enlightening books about him which were heavily criticized because diehard Nirvana fans just couldn't accept that their idol was an asshole.</span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">I said it and I'll always say it: Cobain's feminism was a hoax. It was an image he put up in the media so that everyone would like him. It was just a facade. 90% of the things he said in interviews were lies, therefore the constant contradictions he made. I won't get into too many details because there's A LOT to write but I believe that not only was he a hypocrite but he was also an abuser. He hated women. Kurt was no feminist.&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;comments&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s0">[{</span><span class="s1">&quot;dict Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s3">0</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;Comment Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;h8g8f3a&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;Parent Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;p1nyma&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;content&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;There's a great podcast called Heart Shaped Pod that covers Nirvana's entire history.

I guess that in patriarchy, where women are socialized to serve certain gender-based roles and expectations and where all of its institutions concur to same stereotypes, there's really not much room for freedom of choice.I usually say that if one of my behaviours matches a socially ascribed behaviour, then it is not a result of my choice. I guess that women, as humans and social beings, cannot escape the burden of such roles nor completely avoid  incorporating those behaviours. However, it helps being aware that they are not our </span><span class="s2">\&quot;</span><span class="s1">choice</span><span class="s2">\&quot; </span><span class="s1">and that they are not </span><span class="s2">\&quot;</span><span class="s1">empowering</span><span class="s2">\&quot;  </span><span class="s1">because, regardless of what we feel that they are to us, they have a patriarchical meaning, which is the meaning everyone else attributes to that same behaviour. </span><span class="s2">\n</span><span class="s1">Even if it sounds paradoxical,  for me it is helpful to acknowledge that there's no room for power and choice in traditional gender roles and that opens a whole new world to discover new forms of being an individual, away from the male gaze and the need of social validation.&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;replies&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s0">[</span><span class="s3">3</span><span class="s0">]}</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s0">{</span><span class="s1">&quot;dict Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s3">1</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;Comment Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;h8itxpu&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;Parent Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;p1octb&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;content&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;I can only advise you to listen deeply to yourself. </span><span class="s2">\n</span><span class="s1">It is a rich world of layered meaning once we open the box that you have, which most people keep shut.

Ones that come to mind are: showing that you are a member of a group, indicating your status in a hierarchy, projecting something about your internal world to the external world, to indicate health or fertility, in performance and art, and simply because people like pretty things. </span><span class="s2">\n    \n</span><span class="s1">As we modernize, things become infinitely more complicated and we still have to function within the systems which dictate our values (patriarchy and capitalism being prominent ones) but the base needs are pretty much the same. Our sense of self only exists through what weve experienced and what is around us. With no frame of reference there is no self, and with an open mind that sense of self will continue to change over your lifetime. </span><span class="s2">\n</span><span class="s1">Its good that you can see flaws in oppressive systems but being aware of them doesnt make them go away, it doesnt undo a lifetime of conditioning and it also doesnt make it your fault if you feel influenced or even empowered by them. I guess we just do our best to carve out a niche where we can be happy with ourselves without judging others.</span><span class="s2">\n     \n\n</span><span class="s1">Your body is the vessel which connects you to the physical world, its aspirational to want to look and feel your best. That sense of self coming out rather than blind compliance would mean your appearance should reflect your inner world, and hopefully a positive sense of self.</span><span class="s2">\n\n   \n</span><span class="s1">The only way to develop that self is to have a really varied pool to draw from, as in many types of people, who are interesting or relatable or differ from the status quo, to expand where the input is coming from to beyond patriarchal norms.

</span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">Anime girls are also SOOO sexualized, take Lucy of Fairy Tail for example. Her running gag is basically losing her clothes and running around mostly naked, some times she's fully naked and people just oogle her even though she's obviously flustered and uncomfortable. Then there are the Seven Deadly Sins, where the male lead gropes and talks about Elizabeth's boobs and hips for 'comedic effect'.</span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">Like bro, impressionable children are going to watch the show and think it's okay for them to touch girls' body parts without consent, since the male lead of that show never got told off or got in trouble.</span><span class="s2">\n\n\\</span><span class="s1">-</span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">Then there are the making female characters physically weak, or at least lesser to the male characters' strength. And that's like a whole other can of worms.</span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">I'd say Naruto is an amazing example of this, it's such a mainstream anime it's worrying about the effects it can have on people. </span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">In Naruto, all the female character whole personality revolves around a guy, they have no character depth, no goals (apart from getting into their crushes pants) and not development. If you watch the Chunin Exam arc, there are no female finalists, all of them were knocked out with the most boring, shortest fights. There is only one female Hokage out of like 7, and she nearly got knocked out by the lackey of a sub villain. Not to mention all medic and support positions are filled by women, there are little to no male medics. It's basically saying that a woman's place is in servitude. </span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">&amp;#x200B;</span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">There are so much more examples, but this post is getting kinda long.&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;comments&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s0">[{</span><span class="s1">&quot;dict Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s3">0</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;Comment Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;h89ier7&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;Parent Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;p0vw24&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;content&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;It's not just anime and manga, you see it in Japanese video games, TV, adverts.

Is a woman unhappy? Give her something cute to wear. Or something sweet to eat. Women like cute things and sweets and all their problems can be solved with them.

Gender stereotypes are so deeply entrenched.</span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">The depictions of women in Japanese pornographic content (especially comics) are also very disturbing, since the prevalent trend is for them to act as if they're being raped - crying, begging for the man to stop - even when they're supposedly having a good time.</span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">Then there's the issue of sexualisation of minors.

And it is portrayed as ultimate love. Omfg. I grew up with that manga. I followed that girl's story for years, rooting for her, hoping she would grow out of her toxic crush, hoping to see her lead and fight like she said she wanted, and after 10 years the last image of her I get is her dusting shelves for a guy who doesn't give a fuck. 99% of women who were warriors in that story ended up being housewives while men took all positions of power. </span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">Fairy Tail is horrible too. So many people defend fanservice in Fairy Tail by saying that men there also have perfect bodies and are often shirtless, but it is such bullshit. Men are never stripped against their will, as they scream and beg </span><span class="s2">\&quot;</span><span class="s1">don't do it</span><span class="s2">\&quot; </span><span class="s1">or </span><span class="s2">\&quot;</span><span class="s1">don't look</span><span class="s2">\&quot;</span><span class="s1">, they aren't groped, they aren't shamed for being shirtless, they rarely receive objectifying comments, while it happens to female characters all the time. Men are rarely drawn in their underwear or completely naked, and the camera is definitely never positioning to give us the best view of their crotch. And don't get me started on how often women's spaces are invaded by men who just barge in and make themselves comfortable while girls scream! It is ridiculous how often Lucy is portrayed shaking and crying, because she is stripped and groped by her best friend, the protagonist. And she never confronts him about it.</span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">It is not just shounen animes. Most shoujo and josei mangas (girl mangas) I've read also glorify traditional female roles and portray jealousy and abuse from men as hot and desirable. Nothing makes a heroine more wet than a man imposing his dominance on her by pressing her to a wall or telling others that she is his property. And most shoujo heroines succeed in saving most vile and abusive men from themselves through patience and kindness and empathy, which is a horrible message to feed to young girls. The very fact that 80% - 90% of </span><span class="s2">\&quot;</span><span class="s1">girl mangas</span><span class="s2">\&quot; </span><span class="s1">are focused primarily on love and finding a husband while </span><span class="s2">\&quot;</span><span class="s1">boy mangas explore themes of competition, leadership, professional development, athletisim, stoicism - is very problematic.

Now, there may be some other problematic issues, but at least the the girls/women in the show aren't drawn with massive boobs or wearing clothes too small for them. With the release of Season 4, I remember a lot of criticism over how one of the characters was drawn because she had more masculine features, such as shorter hair, despite this character being an absolute badass and a seasoned soldier.&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;replies&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s0">[</span><span class="s3">102</span><span class="s0">]}</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s0">{</span><span class="s1">&quot;dict Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s3">30</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;Comment Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;h89y8oz&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;Parent Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;p0vw24&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;content&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;Yeah as someone who used to be really into anime as a teenager it's hard for me to look at anime coming out these days and get excited about it now that I'm older and wiser when all the popular seasonal anime is filled with rubbish like this. </span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">If anyone wants recommendations for anime with good female representation I would highly recommend Princess Tutu and Revolutionary Girl Utenna - which are both 'magical girl' shows with a twist which deconstructs the genre.</span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">That is showing my age a bit there though </span><span class="s2">\ud83d\ude05 </span><span class="s1">I haven't watched any new anime in a while&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;replies&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s0">[]}</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s0">{</span><span class="s1">&quot;dict Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s3">31</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;Comment Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;h8acosi&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;Parent Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;p0vw24&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;content&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;Thank you!!!

You're right.</span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">I would also add that they don't all sexualize women in the same way: the ones made for boys and men tend to have more of the </span><span class="s2">\&quot;</span><span class="s1">sexy  girl</span><span class="s2">\&quot; </span><span class="s1">wearing little to no clothing, huge, unnatural boobs kind of thing. The ones made for girls and women have the weak, shy, not empowered at all, extremely dependent girl who always needs to be saved.

They want a man to safe them. This is terrible. </span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">And it's not a problem only to animes and mangas. I've been reading some wevtoons lately, and the ones from Asia (mostly from Korea, some from china) are terrifying sometimes. My grandmother is into K-drama lately, and the episodes I watched with her have the same </span><span class="s2">\&quot;</span><span class="s1">same me</span><span class="s2">\&quot; </span><span class="s1">and </span><span class="s2">\&quot;</span><span class="s1">it's okay if he grabs you without your consent</span><span class="s2">\&quot; </span><span class="s1">vibes. </span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">I'm not saying that everywhere else on earth is free from misogyny (hell, I'm from Brazil), but asian countries make me do sad because they are so developed in technology, but at the same time they face huge problems regarding women's rights - problems that not even I have in Brazil.

Woman summoned to another world to save them with holy powers gets sidelined in favor of a younger model. Left to her own devices she gets involved in magical research,  finds a hot guy and tries to save the day anyway (with her powers).</span><span class="s2">\n\n\n\n</span><span class="s1">Itai no wa iya na no de bogyoryoku. Two young girls who are BFFs play a VRMMORPG. The main character hates getting hurt, so pours every single point into defense and ends up becoming overpowered in surprising ways. This show was so refreshing - two female characters that are well written  enjoy spending time with each other, and are just nice people. Love the creative ways she uses her defensive capabilities in the game. </span><span class="s2">\n\n\n</span><span class="s1">Honzuki no Gekokujou. Librarian wakes up in a magical  world, in the body of a poor, sickly girl. She's devastated to find out that she has no access to books, so decides to create her own.  Fascinating look at basic book/paper making techniques, interesting characters and world-building.</span><span class="s2">\n\n\n</span><span class="s1">Twelve Kingdoms. I rewatch this one at least once or twice a year. Follows the trope of </span><span class="s2">\&quot;</span><span class="s1">high school girl is transported to another world to be their queen</span><span class="s2">\&quot;</span><span class="s1">, but then actually explores what that would be like.  The main character has no idea how to run a country,  and the people who were in power before she got there aren't exactly in a hurry to give that power up. There are several other female characters who are complex and nuanced,  and their stories begin to intertwine towards the end in awesome ways. NOTE: The main character is very weak and scared for the first few eps - she doesn't become a badass till later. If you hate the first few, i recommend reading episode summaries instead and starting at about episode 8? 9? The one where she first meets a king.</span><span class="s2">\n\n\n</span><span class="s1">Yuri on Ice. The female characters aren't generally the focus in this series,  it's just a great show. A washed-up professional ice skater returns home in shame after failure, only to be shocked out of his skin when the world's no. 1 skater follows him there to offer to be his coach.

Women in this anime dress like strippers, but they are really fucking capable and strong and are always at the center of the story, and have great character arcs, and complex relationships with each other, they lead men and are truly respected by men, and the main villain is also a badass woman. These women aren't strong just to be conquered by men and to be prizes to men, they are simply amazing. This show gives reasons for why women undress so much, and these reasons apply to men as well, so men also undress a lot. Basically it is a world where people don't want to wear clothes for a reason.

I acknowledged that exceptions exist: like Chihayafuru or Skip Beat for example. Never said it's 100%. But a lot of manga does leave Japan, the pirate websites upload hundreds of titles, and I sometimes browse through them just for fun. The focus of these mangas is almost always on the love story, on the desired boy, friendships, cute clothes and dates. Ambitions and skill are a secondary focus if explored at all. When japanese people/characters mention shojo manga in doramas, tv shows and in other manga, they acknowledge that it is about </span><span class="s2">\&quot;</span><span class="s1">girly</span><span class="s2">\&quot; </span><span class="s1">romance and make fun of the corny tropes.</span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">It's great if the problem isn't as big as I perceive it to be, but it's hard to believe. </span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">I know nothing about Black Clover, but I've read One Piece, Naruto, Bleach, Fulmetal Alchemist, D.Gray man, Dr. Stone, The Promised Neverland, Shokugeki no Soma, Assassination Classrom, Kimetsu no Yaiba, Attack on Titan, Death Note, Haikyuu.. Yes, shounen mangas aren't without flaws, but they do focus primarily on mastery of skill, leadership and strength in the face of adversity. They celebrate adventure, discipline, competence and courage. That's why I loved this genre when I was growing up even though the portrayal of women in these stories was often sexist and cringe. I identified with male characters.</span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">I acknowledge that there are shounen mangas that are purely about relationships and sexy female bodies like We never learn.

It's a very long game of telephone, and the final product we are left with is those men's interpretations of God, which is inseparable from the culture they were a part of, which was extremely patriarchal.

One of the things they talk about with this passage in particular is the idea that patriarchy was not part of God's original plan for humanity in the garden of Eden. It's part of the curse that happens after they disobey God and eat the fruit. Which is really interesting to think about, because whoever wrote this down would have been living in that time of extreme patriarchy. It would have been so ingrained into the culture that I'm surprised anyone even thought to try to explain why patriarchy exists at all, let alone frame it as a negative consequence. It makes me wonder if there were women influencing those stories through oral traditions, recognizing that patriarchy was harmful to them, and trying to come up with an explanation for why that is.&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;replies&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s0">[]}</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s0">{</span><span class="s1">&quot;dict Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s3">3</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;Comment Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;h8dwr8v&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;Parent Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;h8dvvz2&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;content&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;Plenty of subordination of women in hinduism.</span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">Buddha also stated that accepting women as nuns will accelerate the decay of his doctrine - which did not quite send a gender egalitarian message.&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;replies&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s0">[]}]</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;post link&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;/r/Feminism/comments/p1cytf/book_of_genesis_patriarchal/&quot;</span><span class="s0">}</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s0">{</span><span class="s1">&quot;id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;p0ymyz&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;title&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;Can you be an (intersectional) feminist and antitheist at the same time?&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;ups&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s3">60</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;downs&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s3">0</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;content&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;I</span><span class="s2">\u2019</span><span class="s1">d like to start off by saying I don</span><span class="s2">\u2019</span><span class="s1">t hate religious people; I hate religion.

I grew up Catholic, a very obviously patriarchal religion. Only men are allowed to be priests or deacons, you're not even allowed to have communion if you're gay, getting an abortion will literally get you excommunicated from the church. Then I compare that to the United Christ Church I went to after college, where there was this incredible woman pastor with a doctorate in theology, LGBTQ+ folks were openly embraced (like, seriously, there were rainbow flags on every wall), when they spoke about God, they used all different gendered pronouns and called God the Holy Parent instead of the Father, and where they never read a single passage from the old testament. Yes they are both Christians, but I couldn't imagine anyone describing the UCC as misogynistic. I don't go to that church anymore either, I'm more nontheist/agnostic these days. My parents aren't Catholic anymore either, they go to a Lutheran church now. Which isn't nearly as liberal as the UCC, but the pastor's son there gave a speech at service during pride month about how we as Christians need to do a better job about including our LGBTQ+ siblings. And I feel like it's a largely positive community. I think for people whose faith is deeply precious to them, and part of their cultural identity, it's insulting to them to be told that their identity is problematic. Obviously Christians are a privileged group in the US, but antisemitism and Islamophobia are real issues in the same category as racism, and I think that's where the intersectionality is most important.&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;replies&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s0">[]}</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s0">{</span><span class="s1">&quot;dict Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s3">7</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;Comment Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;h8brfq0&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;Parent Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;h89ydwz&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;content&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;I don't think it's fair to say intersectionality *PROTECTS* faith, but it recognizes the cultural impacts that religion has. </span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">Having grown up grown up around it, I'll use it as an example, but a generation ago my relatives were part of the Italian American Catholic Community and that is closely interwoven with their culture and identify. While I don't identify with the religion at all, for them there is just no way to seperate the culture from the religion. They aren't zealots, they question and critique it ALL the time, they won't do everything that is said, but it's just unthinkable based on the culture they are apart of to NOT be Catholic, to not hold that label.</span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">So to me, this is what intersectionality is. It's understanding these perspectives, and how they are inextricably linked sometimes, and are additive in terms of oppression. It doesn't mean we just say, well because of intersectionality I have to respect all beliefs without question, and give them an equal platform and pretend the are equally valid, including ones that try to take away my bodily autonomy, say that I'm property, or other such nonsense.&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;replies&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s0">[]}</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s0">{</span><span class="s1">&quot;dict Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s3">8</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;Comment Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;h8akgii&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;Parent Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;h8a1gfi&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;content&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;Right </span><span class="s2">\u2014 </span><span class="s1">how feminism intersects with disability, or race, or class etc</span><span class="s2">\u2026</span><span class="s1">&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;replies&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s0">[]}]</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;post link&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;/r/Feminism/comments/p0ymyz/can_you_be_an_intersectional_feminist_and/&quot;</span><span class="s0">}</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s0">{</span><span class="s1">&quot;id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;p12fxt&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;title&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;A child sexual assault survivor and a female nurse team up to dismantle virginity and the myths around the hymen.

The circumstances of the case were about as follows:  </span><span class="s2">\n</span><span class="s1">&gt;  </span><span class="s2">\n</span><span class="s1">&gt;A wealthy merchant of Philadelphia consulted Professor Pancoast to learn why his home was childless. The man was forty-one years of age, of sound body as far as he knew, had a good family history, and had never suffered from any serious illness in his life, barring a slight attack of gonorrhea in his youth, while sowing the proverbial </span><span class="s2">\u201c</span><span class="s1">wild oats.</span><span class="s2">\u201d  \n</span><span class="s1">&gt;  </span><span class="s2">\n</span><span class="s1">&gt;His wife was ten years his junior, a perfect picture of health, and a product one of the old Quaker families of wealth and distinction in Quakerville.  </span><span class="s2">\n</span><span class="s1">&gt;  </span><span class="s2">\n</span><span class="s1">&gt;An appointment was made with the both for an examination at the Sansom Street hospital, and a section of the senior class, of which I was one, was called upon to assist the Professor. The supposition on the part of the Professor was that the woman was unable to conceive because of some impediment which possibly might be removed. Therefore, she was examined first. The examination was very complete, almost as perfect as an army examination, but not the slightest abnormal condition was discovered. As a matter of possible public interest, I will say that during this examination was discovered for the first time, as far as I know, the suction function of the uterus, which takes place during orgasm.  </span><span class="s2">\n</span><span class="s1">&gt;  </span><span class="s2">\n</span><span class="s1">&gt;The man was then examined; and while no physical defect was discoverable, the spermatic fluid was shown by the microscopic examination to be absolutely void of spermatozoons. This, of course, cleared up the situation at once, and the man was informed that the fault was his, and probably due to results of the gonorrhea in his youth. Professor Pancoast at that time considered the trouble as easily remedied, and began a course of treatment which he thought proper.  </span><span class="s2">\n</span><span class="s1">&gt;  </span><span class="s2">\n</span><span class="s1">&gt;But after two months</span><span class="s2">\u2019 </span><span class="s1">careful attention, the man showed no change whatever, and the Professor then concluded that the primary seminal ducts were occluded by the former inflammation extending upward from the urethra. A joking remark by one the class, </span><span class="s2">\u201c</span><span class="s1">the only solution of this problem is to call in the hired man,</span><span class="s2">\u201d </span><span class="s1">was the probable incentive to the plan of action which followed. The woman was chloroformed, and with a hard rubber syringe some fresh semen from the best-looking member of the class was deposited in the uterus, and the cervix slightly plugged with gauze. Neither the man nor the woman knew the nature of what had been done at the time, but subsequently the Professor repented of his action, and explained the whole matter to the husband. Strange as it may seem, the man was delighted with the idea, and conspired with the Professor in keeping from the lady the actual way by which her impregnation was brought about. In due course of time the lady gave birth to a son, and he had characteristics features, not of the senior student, but of the willing but impossible father.  </span><span class="s2">\n</span><span class="s1">&gt;  </span><span class="s2">\n</span><span class="s1">&gt;That boy is now a business man of the city of New York, and I have shaken his hands with him within the past year.  </span><span class="s2">\n</span><span class="s1">&gt;  </span><span class="s2">\n</span><span class="s1">&gt;Since then there has been formed an association for the purpose of producing artificial impregnation of women who may for any reason give a written consent to such a proceeding. From a nature point of view the idea of artificial impregnation offers valuable advantages. The mating of human beings must, from the nature of things, be a matter of sentiment alone. Persons of the worst possible promise of good and healthy offspring are being lawfully united in marriage everyday. Marriage is a proposition which is not submitted to good judgment or even common sense, as a rule. No Burbank methods are possible, even tho they be ideal. Artificial impregnation by carefully selected seed, alone will solve the problem. It may at first shock the delicate sensibilities of the sentimental who consider that the source of the seed indicates the true father, but when the scientific fact becomes known that the origin of the spermatozoa which generates the ovum is of no more importance that the personality of the finger which pulls the trigger of a gun, then objections will lose their forcefulness, and artificial impregnation become recognized as a race-uplifting procedure.  </span><span class="s2">\n</span><span class="s1">&gt;  </span><span class="s2">\n</span><span class="s1">&gt;It is gradually becoming well established that the mother is the complete builder of the child. It is her blood that gives it material for its body, and her nerve energy which is divided to supply its vital force. It is her mental ideals which go to influence, to some extent at least, the features, the tendencies, and the mental caliber of the child. </span><span class="s2">\u201c</span><span class="s1">Many a man rocks another man</span><span class="s2">\u2019</span><span class="s1">s child and thinks he is rocking his own,</span><span class="s2">\u201d </span><span class="s1">for it looks like him. And often two children by the same parents have feature entirely dissimilar. It is the predominating mental ideals prevailing with the mother that shapes the destiny of the child. The man who thrusts his nose into a beautiful blossom to surfeit his sense of smell on the sweet perfume is merely breathing the lustful odor from the sexual organ of the plant; and if his nose displaces some of the pollen, he may be the father of the next flower. If a honey bee does the work, it might be called the father.  </span><span class="s2">\n</span><span class="s1">&gt;  </span><span class="s2">\n</span><span class="s1">&gt;A scientific study of sex selection, without regard to marriage conditions, might result in giving some men children of wonderful endowments, in place of half-witted, evil-inclined, disease-disposed offspring which they are ashamed to call their own. The mechanical method of impregnation, whether it be the orthodox way, or the aseptic surgeon</span><span class="s2">\u2019</span><span class="s1">s skillful fingers, counts but little, except sentiment, and sentiment is fast becoming a servant instead of a master in the affairs of the human race. Few are the children that are brought intentionally into this world. As a rule they are but the incidental result of a journey in search of selfish pleasure. They are seldom sought, and often unwelcome when they pout in their first appearance. The subsequent mother</span><span class="s2">\u2019</span><span class="s1">s love is largely a matter of growth, for affection is but an attribute of selfishness.  </span><span class="s2">\n</span><span class="s1">&gt;  </span><span class="s2">\n</span><span class="s1">&gt;The man who may think this idea shocking probably has millions of gonococci swarming in his seminal ducts, and probably his wife has had a laparotomy which nearly cost her life itself, as a result of his infecting her with the crop reaped from his last planting of </span><span class="s2">\u201c</span><span class="s1">wild oats.</span><span class="s2">\u201d </span><span class="s1">One man in every five in New York City was found to be free from the contamination of venereal disease to an extant that rendered him safe </span><span class="s2">\\</span><span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">\&quot;</span><span class="s1">unsafe?</span><span class="s2">\&quot;\\</span><span class="s1">] around the house in which a woman lived.  </span><span class="s2">\n</span><span class="s1">&gt;  </span><span class="s2">\n</span><span class="s1">&gt;Go ask the blind children whose eyes were saturated with the gonorrheal pus as they struggled thru the birth canal to merge into this world of darkness to endure a Living Death; ask them what is the not shocking thing in this whole world.

During the civil war he served as a surgeon in the army. In 1874 he succeeded his father as professor in Jefferson medical college. In 1884 he secured the bodies of the Siamese twins, and proved that the band could not have been safely cut except in their childhood.

From the start, at least as far as we can tell from the first purported use of donor insemination in 1884 by Dr. William Pancoast (The Medical World, April 1909 pp. 163-164: Letter to the Editor), it appears that one of his unknown medical students, jokingly called the </span><span class="s2">\u201c</span><span class="s1">Hired Hand,</span><span class="s2">\u201d </span><span class="s1">was used in order to deceive the wife about the process and to encourage her to believe that her husband was the father. There was no informed consent and the husband was told only after the wife became pregnant.

Personally, I'd argue that in terms of foreign policy, the two US parties are not too different. The US(or any of its allies) were never in Afghanistan to secure women's rights even if that was a by product of their activities. Frankly, the US failed most of its actual strategic goals in being in Afghanistan and had no real support to stay( across the political spectrum the American people's appetite for intervention in the Muslim majority world seems to be far less than the post-9/11 high). I would say that the pulling out of American forces is to expected regardless of who was in charge.
