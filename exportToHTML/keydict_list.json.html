An exchange for someone's image to promote your product is not like investing in securities, startups, or properties. Its not subject to the same taxation laws or accounting rules. Nike doesn't expect to use anyone's image in 15-30 years years.

This parental leave goes on for up to 16 months in total, split between the parents. During this parental leave, the employer still:</span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">1. Recruits and hires substitutes,</span><span class="s2">\n</span><span class="s1">2. Pays employee tax,</span><span class="s2">\n</span><span class="s1">3. Pays the yearly vacation salary,</span><span class="s2">\n</span><span class="s1">4. Frequently (if mandated by e.g. a collective agreement struck between employer and union) pays an extra </span><span class="s2">\&quot;</span><span class="s1">parental salary</span><span class="s2">\&quot; </span><span class="s1">to complement what the state is handing out.</span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">It's quite generous, and it probably goes without saying that it is also **illegal as fuck** for employers to cut pay or fire expecting mothers/parents for pregnancy reasons. Companies that try it anyway (citing BS reasons) risks getting dragged to court and sued for serious cash.</span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">&gt;What does this have anything to do with feminism?</span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">The definition of feminism, as found on Wikipedia:</span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">&gt;Feminism is a range of social movements, political movements, and ideologies that aim to define and establish the political, **economic**, personal, and social equality of the sexes.</span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">What we're talking about here is *economic* equality between the sexes. Women should not risk workplace repercussions for getting pregnant while men go scot-free, especially since becoming a parent is 1) extremely common, 2) a huge deal in peoples' lives, and 3) actually desired by our society. :) Our species needs to procreate to continue its existence, so it makes zero sense to punish women for it.</span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">I'd like to think that the reason this works so well in my country, with employers and employees alike accepting this, is because the rules apply to everyone: companies can't get an edge by firing pregnant people when it suits them, so the playing field is level. Paying for employees on parental leave is just the cost of doing business here.</span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">Ultimately, it is indeed an investment.

The bible was originally a series of stories that were passed down through oral history and eventually written down, by men. It's a very long game of telephone, and the final product we are left with is those men's interpretations of God, which is inseparable from the culture they were a part of, which was extremely patriarchal. (The writing of the book of Genesis predates Christianity by about 1500 years.)</span><span class="s2">\n</span><span class="s1">I've been listening to this really lovely podcast lately, called Two Feminists Annotate the Bible, where these two women go through the whole thing and talk about all the issues and how they resolve that with their faith. One of the things they talk about with this passage in particular is the idea that patriarchy was not part of God's original plan for humanity in the garden of Eden. It's part of the curse that happens after they disobey God and eat the fruit. Which is really interesting to think about, because whoever wrote this down would have been living in that time of extreme patriarchy. It would have been so ingrained into the culture that I'm surprised anyone even thought to try to explain why patriarchy exists at all, let alone frame it as a negative consequence. It makes me wonder if there were women influencing those stories through oral traditions, recognizing that patriarchy was harmful to them, and trying to come up with an explanation for why that is.&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;replies&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s0">[]}</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s0">{</span><span class="s1">&quot;dict Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s3">3</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;Comment Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;h8dwr8v&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;Parent Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;h8dvvz2&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;content&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;Plenty of subordination of women in hinduism.</span><span class="s2">\n\n</span><span class="s1">Buddha also stated that accepting women as nuns will accelerate the decay of his doctrine - which did not quite send a gender egalitarian message.&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;replies&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s0">[]}]</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;post link&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;/r/Feminism/comments/p1cytf/book_of_genesis_patriarchal/&quot;</span><span class="s0">}</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s0">{</span><span class="s1">&quot;id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;p0a4on&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;title&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;The beheading of a diplomat's daughter shows how badly Pakistan is failing its women&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;ups&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s3">215</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;downs&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s3">0</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;content&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;comments&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s0">[{</span><span class="s1">&quot;dict Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s3">0</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;Comment Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;h863by9&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;Parent Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;p0a4on&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;content&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;The Islamic Council is holding Human Rights there hostage.&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;replies&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s0">[</span><span class="s3">3</span><span class="s0">]}</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s0">{</span><span class="s1">&quot;dict Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s3">1</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;Comment Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;h85xon7&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;Parent Id&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;p0a4on&quot;</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">&quot;content&quot;</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&quot;Extremely brutal and sadistic.

Personally, I'd argue that in terms of foreign policy, the two US parties are not too different. The US(or any of its allies) were never in Afghanistan to secure women's rights even if that was a by product of their activities. Frankly, the US failed most of its actual strategic goals in being in Afghanistan and had no real support to stay( across the political spectrum the American people's appetite for intervention in the Muslim majority world seems to be far less than the post-9/11 high). I would say that the pulling out of American forces is to expected regardless of who was in charge.
